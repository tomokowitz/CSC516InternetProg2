Homework 3

All homework for this semester that use a database will  either use the file 
bakery.accdb or bakery.mdb. Both files are contained in a zip file named 
bakery.zip. Download it and unzip the files. Register one of them using ODBC.

The ER diagram for this database is:



 

Your project (named <lastname>3 - for example avitabile3) should include the following:

A program named <lastname>3a.java that, using a Prepared Statement, executes the
query of your choice from the database and outputs the results.
A program named <lastname>3b.java that lets the user enter data to be inserted
into the CAKES table, thereby adding a new cake.
Make sure that your URL for the connection is: jdbc:odbc:bakery
