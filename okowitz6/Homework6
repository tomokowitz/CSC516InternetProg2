Homework 6
 
Create a project named <lastname>6

Write an JSP file named <lastname>6a.jsp that populates the options of a select with all CUSTOMERID values.
 
The SQL statement to get this without duplicates is
 
SELECT DISTINCT CUSTOMERID FROM CUSTOMERS
 
The action of the form that contains the select is to go to another JSP named <lastname>6b.jsp that will print (in a table) the ORDERID, DATE, and LOCATION for each ORDER record with that CUSTOMERID.
