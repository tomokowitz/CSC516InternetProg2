Homework 12
 
The video lectures for Struts 1, Struts 2, and Struts 3 contain enough 
information to do this assignment.
 
Create a struts application in a project named <lastname>12 that will have the following features:
    -an initial html file named <lastname>12.jsp that will allow a user to 
    enter for a new ORDERS record.
    -a jsp page named <lastname>success.jsp that will display a table of 
        information about all ORDERS records in the database (including the new one)
        - don't worry if the.new record doesn't show up immediately.
    -a series of jsp pages that will display the reason why the new ORDERS 
        record could not have been entered. These reasons should include that 
        the ORDERID already exists, that the CUSTOMERID does not exist in the 
        CUSTOMERS table, or that one or more of the data fields are empty.
    - new subclass of Action named <lastname>12Action.java that will figure out 
        what to do.
    - struts-config.xml
