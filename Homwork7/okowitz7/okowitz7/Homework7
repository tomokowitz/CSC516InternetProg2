Homework 7
 
Create a project named <lastname>7.
 
Write an HTML file named <lastname>7.htm that contains form elements to let someone enter a person's name and the number of cakes that person has ordered.. The action of the HTML file should go to a jsp file named <lastname>7.jsp.
 
The jsp will calculate the total and delivery fee for that order for that person.
 
Delivery fee is calculated like this:
cakes * 2

Total is calculated like this:
cakes * 12 + deliveryfee

 
The jsp will output the name, cakes sold, delivery fee, and total for that person.
 
If any field of the input is empty, an appropriate error message should be printed.
 
Make sure you load all parameter values into a bean named <lastname>7.java. It will make it much easier to do homework 8 if you do this.
 
You cannot use any java scriptlets in your jsp page. Use only JSTL tags.
