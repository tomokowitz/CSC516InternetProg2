Homework 5
 
 Create a project named <lastname>5. Put the following within it:
Write an html file named <lastname>5.htm that lets the user enter data to be 
inserted into the CAKES table, and write a servlet named <lastname>5a.java 
that checks to see if there already is a cake with that CAKEID. If everything’s 
ok, do a forward to a second servlet named <lastname>5b.java that does the 
insert. If there’s a problem, do a forward to a third servlet named 
<lastname>5c.java that prints an error message.
