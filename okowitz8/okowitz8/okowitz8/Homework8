Homework 8
 
Modify Homework 7 in the following way:
 
Have a second jsp named <lastname>8.jsp that will display in a table the data 
for all people entered in this session using the first jsp. You will want to 
have another Bean named <lastname>8.java that includes an ArrayList. 
This bean should include methods that let you add a <lastname>7 object 
to the ArrayList (setPerson) and return the ArrayList (getAll).
 
You cannot use any java scriptlets in your jsp page. Use only JSTL tags.
